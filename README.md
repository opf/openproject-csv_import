# OpenProject Csv Import Plugin

Allows importing WorkPackages into OpenProject via CSV. For an example see [the spec fixtures](https://github.com/opf/openproject-csv_import/blob/dev/spec/fixtures/work_packages.csv).

The import can also include multiple states of a work packages each witht the timestamp at which that stage was entered into. That way, the data can be imported in its historic occurence.

## Compatibility

The last time this plugin was used was in combination with OpenProject 10.5. Recent changes e.g. to the rails version suggest, that some maintenance has to take place before it becomes compatible again.
